**題目：** Generative Information Retrieval

**講演者：** Donald Metzler先生（Google）

**日時：** 2023年3月16日（木）09:00-10:00

**会場：** オンライン（Zoom）

**概要：** Generative language models have proven to be highly effective for a wide range of tasks. There has
been growing interest and application of these models to traditional information retrieval problems.
In this talk, I will provide an overview of so-called generative information retrieval models. I
will then describe two specific applications of such models. The first application focuses on using
language models to retrieve/rank documents by directly generating document identifiers from a model.
These so-called differentiable search indexes are effective in various settings vs. sparse and dense
retrieval models, but have their limitations, which leaves opportunity for future work. The second
application is attributed question answering, which takes a question as input and generates a
long-form natural language response with citations/attribution back to original sources. A range of
different modeling strategies are proposed and evaluated using a novel suite of attribution-focused
metrics.

**講演者プロフィール：** Donald Metzler is a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google Research., where he leads a group
focused on problems at the intersection of information retrieval, natural language processing, and
machine learning. Prior to that, he was a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Southern
California (USC) and a Senior Research Scientist at Yahoo!. He has served as the Program Chair of
the WSDM, ICTIR, and OAIR conferences and sat on the editorial boards of all the major journals in
his field. He has published over 100 research papers, has been awarded 9 patents, and is a co-author
of "Search Engines: Information Retrieval in Practice".
